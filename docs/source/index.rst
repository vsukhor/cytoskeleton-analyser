cytoskeleton-analyser
=====================

Examines simulated cell microtubules

A postprocessor for extraction, analysis and human-friendly presentation of the raw binary results generated by Explicit-Microtubules.

**Explicit-Microtubules** is a C++ simulator of the whole-cell microtubule system.
It reconstructs computationally the microtubule geometry and real-time dynamics in 3d space and time using stochastic algorithms.
In the course of the simulation based on a multitude of bioogical information, it outputs detailed histories of microtubule dynamics along with three-dimensional snapshots of microtubules.
However, designed to be focuced on versatile generation procedures, Explicit-Microtubules only includes basic data analysis.

Complementing the simulator, **cytoskeleton-analyser** is designed to extract, analyse and visualize various characteristics of the stochastically reconstructed microtubule system.
